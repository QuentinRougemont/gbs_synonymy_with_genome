# GBS synonymy with genome

# TODO

- Fill README.md
- Run on new dataset and polish

## Set of script to identify synonymous and non synonymous mutation as well as deleterious Âµ

*   initially developped for GBS data and make use of reference genome and transcriptome of the species
*   I am still testing it with whole genome data

To run the pipeline simply use the script in chronoligcal order

Make sur to read all the scripts and format the data appropriately

#### Note:

the final step of running provean can be done:
*    either in parallel (using `08.b_run_provean_iteration.sh` and `08.a_run_provean_parallel.sh`)

*    or with a single CPUs using the `script 07_run_provean.sh`
